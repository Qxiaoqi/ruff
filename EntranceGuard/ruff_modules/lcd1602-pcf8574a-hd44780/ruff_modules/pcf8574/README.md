# PCF8574 Driver

PCF8574 Driver I2C to GPIO device.

## Supported Engines

* Ruff: >=1.2.0 <2.0.0

## Supported Models

- [pcf8574](https://rap.ruff.io/devices/pcf8574)
- pcf8574a

## Installing

> If you are using an LCD device with `PCF8574`/`PCF8574A` built-in,
> you should probably use the LCD model (for example `LCD1602-02`) instead of built-in `PCF8574` device model.

Execute following command and enter a **supported model** to install.

```sh
# Please replace `<device-id>` with a proper ID.
# And this will be what you are going to query while `$('#<device-id>')`.
rap device add <device-id>

# Then enter a supported model, for example:
# ? model: pcf8574
```
